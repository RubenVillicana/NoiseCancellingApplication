Abstract:

This repositroy contains the project form the Laboratory of Digital Signal Processing. It was developed a noise cancellation algorithm by using filters and the STFT. 

The first approach consists on using notch filters to attenuate the frequency componentes of the signal where the noise is allocated. 

The second approach uses the Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) to analyse the signal in three dimentios: Time, frequency and aplitude. It is also knwon as Spectrogram. Mathematical opperation was applied to cancel unwanted noise.

There are a MATLAB script and a MATLAB live script for each approach in this folder. An Graphical User Interface (GUI) was also developed for the user. To use it, a MATLAB app should be installed.
